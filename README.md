Scraping data from biorxiv

This script extracts metrics from biorxiv (such as the number of abstract and pdf views) for all papers that have been published on biorxiv.com. Moreover, the program searches google scholar for available citation information. However, in the current state of the script, google realizes a bot is at work and prevents further access.
